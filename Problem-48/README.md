# Project-Euler-Problem-48

Motivation:

Complete every Euler problem dealing with primes or the Fibonacci sequence.

Aim:

Find the summation.

Use:

Run as found.

Implementation:

Brute force.  No faster method needed due to small input set size.  Could change out current method for exponentiation by doubling for speed.
